%%  Notes:
%
%   1) Package instalation: unzip the files to a directory and run the
%   script of "main_runEigenCNN.m", which reproduce the 
%    results of Eigen-CNN reported in above paper.
%
%
%   2) MatConvNet toolbox must be installed before running this demo.
%      MatConvNet is an implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks
%      (CNNs) for MATLAB. The MatConvNet package  is available at the
%      matconvnet web page:
%      https://github.com/vlfeat/matconvnet?tab=readme-ov-file
%
%
%   3)  EigenCNN.m FastHyIn.m  script implents the respective algorithm.
